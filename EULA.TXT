Your exclusive remedy for any breach of the Limited Warranty is for you to give us notice of the breach by returning to PI Engineering (at the address shown below) a copy of your purchase receipt for your copy of the Software Product and a description of the alleged breach, and then, at PI Engineering's option, PI Engineering shall either: (a) return the price you paid (if any) for the Software Product (at which time your rights under this EULA are deemed to have terminated); or (b) repair or replace the Software Product.
