	    <p>The X-keys .NET components are designed to make integrating X-keys into applications easier than ever. With a simplified API that encapsulates much of the functionality of the standard SDK, developers no longer need to get wrapped up in complex or time-consuming tasks, enabling cleaner and more rapid integration.</p>
          <p>Should you have any additional questions, please  e-mail <a href="mailto:tech@piengineering.com">tech@piengineering.com</a> or call (517) 655-5523 ex. 19.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 10px; ">Installing the Component</h2></div>
        	
            
      <p>The first step is to install the X-keys .NET component(s) that you would 
        like to use into Visual Studio. Visual Studio 2010 or newer is required, 
        though it does not matter if it is an Express or Professional edition.</p>
            <p>Each X-keys .NET component is designed for a specific type of device (for example, the XK-24), so if handling assorted X-keys is desired, be sure to install the component for each. A generic component is introducted starting in PI Engineering SDK v1061. This component is designed to work with all of our products on a basic level. </p>
            <p>To run the appropriate installer, find the component's Install folder (sample path: C:\Program Files (x86)\PI Engineering\PI Engineering SDK\.NET Components\<em>product folder</em>\Install\) and <strong>double-click on the .vscontent file</strong> contained therein.</p>
            
      <p>After successful install, the component should be available to be dragged 
        onto a form from the Toolbox in Visual Studio.</p>
      <p>The samples make use of the .NET class library PIEHid32Net.dll and the 
        .NET component dll file. The sample already has both dlls located in the 
        proper directories and added as references but if starting with a new 
        project one must copy the PIEHid32Net.dll to the desired project directory. Then in Visual Studio 
        right click on the project name and select Add Reference, click on the 
        Browse tab and select PIEHid32Net.dll. The .NET component dll will be 
        automatically added once it is dragged onto the form from the Toolbox. 
      </p>
	  <p>If the component install fails it can be installed manually. Right click on the toolbox and select Choose Items..., under the .NET Framework Components tab select Browse and navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\PI Engineering\PI Engineering SDK\.NET Components\<em>product folder</em>\Install and select the component dll. The component now appears in the list. Click OK. The component should now be available to be dragged onto a form from the Toolbox in Visual Studio.</p>

   <div id="properties">
   	  <h2>Properties</h2>
            <h3>AutoEnumerate</h3>
            <p>Whether or not the software will attempt to enumerate X-keys devices and setup interfaces automatically when a recognized
              
              X-keys device is connected. </p>
      <p>Default value is <strong>True</strong>. Set to <strong>False</strong> to disable this functionality. </p>
            <p><em>If set to False, the developer will need to call the Enumerate() method explicitly each time they wish to detect and work with new devices.</em></p>
            <h3>ConnectedDevices</h3>
            <p>Collection of connected devices. Not available at design time, as enumeration must occur to fill in the list. Most component methods require that the index of the correct device is passed; if only one device is connected this will always be 0. As further devices are connected they are added to the collection.</p>
            
      <p>The ConnectedDevices structure contains:<br>
        <strong>int BaudRate</strong>-XC-RS232 DB9 only. Baudrate of the device, 8 possible values; 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115400. Factory default is 9600. <br>
		<strong>int FirmwareVersion</strong>-The firmware version of the device. <br>
        <strong>bool IsDeviceLock</strong>-True if the device is locked via password protection, false if it is not.  This is not the same as the security key (dongle) which can be implemented by users.  Locking can only be done by P.I. Engineering at the factory.  The following features are disabled on locked devices: changing unit id, changing OEM id, changing Pid, saving the backlighting state, SendKeystrokes, SendJoystick, SendMouse, SetSecurityKey and writing of macros using either MacroWorks 3.1 or X-keys Basic Setup. <br>
        <strong>bool JoystickInterface</strong>-True if a joystick endpoint is available.  A joystick endpoint is required in order to use SendJoystick. Endpoints for each X-keys device are listed in the P.I.Engineering SDK Help under X-keys Data Reports. <br>
        <strong>bool KeyboardInterface</strong>-True if a keyboard endpoint is available.  A keyboard endpoint is required in order to use SendKeystrokes. Endpoints for each X-keys device are listed in the P.I.Engineering SDK Help under X-keys Data Reports. <br>
        <strong>byte[] lastdata</strong>-The raw input report last received.  See the P.I. Engineering SDK Help for details.<br>
		<strong>int lastTbar</strong>-XKE-124 T-bar only. The calibrated T-bar value last received.<br>
        <strong>bool MouseInterface</strong>-True if a mouse endpoint is available.  A mouse endpoint is required in order to use SendMouse. Endpoints for each X-keys device are listed in the P.I.Engineering SDK Help under X-keys Data Reports. <br>
        <strong>bool MultimediaInterface</strong>-True if a multimedia endpoint is available.  A multimedia endpoint is required in order to use SendMultimedia or SendMultimediaPower. Endpoints for each X-keys device are listed in the P.I.Engineering SDK Help under X-keys Data Reports. <br>
		<strong>int OEMVersion</strong>-The device's actual OEM Version ID. This 
        is different from the TargetOEMVersionID which is the desired OEM Version 
        ID. If the OEMVersion is different from the TargetOEMVersionID and the 
        TargetOEMVersionID is not -1 then this device would be ignored. Note some 
        devices such as the XK-12 Jog &amp; Shuttle do not have an OEMVersion 
        ID. <br>
		<strong>XkeysParityType Parity</strong>-XC-RS232 DB9 only. Parity of the device, 3 possible values; XkeysParityType.None, XkeysParityType.Even, XkeysParityType.Odd. Factory default is XkeysParityType.None. <br>
        <strong>bool PassThrough</strong>-XC-RS232 DB9 only. True if user wishes to receive incoming data from the connected RS232 device. Factory default is True. <br>
		<strong>int Pid</strong>-The Product ID of this device. This is different from the TargetProductID which is the desired Product ID. If the Pid is different from the TargetProductID and the TargetProductID is not -1 then this device would be ignored.<br>
        <strong>int PieHandle</strong>-The actual handle used by PIEHid32Net.dll.  If using the raw calls from PIEHid32Net.dll as demonstrated in the P.I. Engineering SDK use this handle. <br>
        <strong>string ProductString</strong>-Description of the device. <br>
        <strong>int ReadLength</strong>-Length of the device's input report. <br>
		<strong>bool SendAsciiToKeyboard</strong>-XC-RS232 DB only. If True all incoming ASCII messages from the connected serial device will be converted and sent out to the keyboard. For example if there is an RS232 message "31 0D" when this message is sent "1" followed by a carriage return is typed out. This feature requires the IAB-RS232 to have a keyboard endpoint. Factory default is False. <br>
        <strong>int UnitID</strong>-The device's Unit ID. This is different from the TargetUnitID which is the desired Unit ID. If the UnitID is different from the TargetUnitID and the TargetUnitID is not -1 then this device would be ignored. <br>
        <strong>int WriteLength</strong>-Length of the device's output report.</p>
      <p><font face="monospace">lblUID.Text = &quot;Unit ID: &quot; + xk24_1.ConnectedDevices[0].UnitID.ToString();</font></p>
      <h3>Enabled</h3>
            <p>Whether or not the device will send input to the computer. Default value is <strong>True</strong>. Change to <strong>False</strong> to temporarily disable the X-keys input.</p>
            
            <h3>Name</h3>
      <p>The name you will use to refer to the component from within your code. Standard control naming rules apply.</p>
      <h3>TargetOEMVersionID</h3>
      <p>What OEM Version IDs the component will handle. This ID can be used by the OEM/developer to distinguish devices they sell their clients from standard off-the-shelf devices, or any other developer-defined purpose.</p>
      <p>Default value is <strong>-1</strong> which means that the software will work with any OEM Version ID. Change this to a specific value (<strong>0-65535</strong>) to limit the software to only devices with that ID. </p>
      <h3>TargetProductID</h3>             
            <p>What Product IDs, or PIDs, the software will handle. Default value is <strong>-1</strong> which means that the component will handle all valid software mode PIDs for a particular type of device. Change value to a specific, <em>valid</em> PID for the device (for example, with the XK-24, either <strong>1029</strong> or <strong>1027</strong>) to limit the component to a particular PID.</p>
            
      <h3>TargetUnitID</h3>
            <p>What Unit IDs, or UIDs, the component will handle. </p>
      <p>Unit IDs are typically used by developers to distinguish between two or more otherwise identical X-keys devices. More than one device can have the same Unit ID without issue, but usually the devices will perform the same actions when buttons are pushed.</p>
            <p>Default value is <strong>-1</strong> which means that the software will work with any UID. Change value to a specific UID (<strong>0-255</strong>) to limit the software to a particular UID.      </p>
